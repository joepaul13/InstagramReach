# InstagramReach
A data analysis project that analyses an Instagram account and shows insights.
The scatter plots show the relationship between likes, comments and shares to the account impressions.
A machine learning model is also trained using the test data. The model used is PassiveAggressiveRegressor from SKLearn
I have used Plotly for the scatter plots and Seaborn for the graphs
The main words in the Instagram account have also been showcased using WordCloud.
